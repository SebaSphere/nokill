# NoKill

This is a work-in-progress mod for Minecraft Fabric that adds the ability to enable or disable PvP, as well as allowing players to duel each other.

# Usage
To enable or disable PvP combat, use the command /pvp enable or /pvp disable.

To initiate a duel, use the command /pvp challenge <player>. This will send a request to the specified player to duel as long as within a configurable ammount of blocks.

If they accept, PVP will be enabled for both players if disabled alongside a chat message broadcasting to all players. If they decline, no duel will take place.
